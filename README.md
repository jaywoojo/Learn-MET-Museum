## Project Summary ##

Based on the concept of "read a book a week", this app is useful for those who wish to log-in once a day and learn about a new art piece. The app utilizes the Metrapolitan Museum of Art's public API (https://metmuseum.github.io/), consisting of thousands of art pieces, to gather information. 
The app has two modes: the "learn mode" and the "quiz mode". where the learn mode allows you to pick a certain art department, for example, "Asian Art" or "European Paintings". Each department has tens of thousands of art pieces, each referenced by a specific objectID, and the app will randomly generate data about an art piece. It will generate a photo of the piece, title, artist, medium, object date, and culture.


## In development... ##

Current development undergoing for the quiz mode, where after learning about a piece the app will store the data using SQLite and be able to create a multiple choice quiz. Also, currently only two departments generate art pieces (easy copy and paste fix).
